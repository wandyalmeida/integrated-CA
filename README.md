# ÉirVid Prototype Movie Rental System 🎥

## 🚀 Introduction

Following the success of YouTube Movies, RTÉ is seeking to add movie rental functionality, ÉirVid, to its video streaming service, RTÉ Player. Our team has been contracted to design and write a prototype of this service, combining skills from two of our classes this semester.

## 🎯 ÉirVid Functionality

ÉirVid will provide the following features:

- 📧 Allow users to create and log into accounts with an email and a password.
- 🎬 Allow a user to rent a movie.
- ⏱️ For this prototype, rental duration is 1 minute for each movie.
- 📊 Keep track of what movies a user has rented.
- 📈 Recommend to users the 5 most rented movies of the past 5 minutes.

## 👥 Group Requirements

Our team is responsible for all the planning, designing, and testing in relation to the OOAD class, and we will do all of the object-oriented Java programming in relation to the AADP class.

## 📝 Report

Our team will be creating a report. This group report will include a reflection on how the team divided up all the tasks and clearly state what each team member contributed to the overall planning and prototyping of this system.

### OOAD Class Requirements

For the software planning part of the project, each team is required to create the requirements and functional analysis of the system, including:

- 📚 A problem definition that describes this entire e-services type of system and details specifically what problems the ÉirVid software system will solve.
- 📋 A full list of requirements regarding the system.
- 📐 Use of UML diagrams, as appropriate. For the Use Case diagrams, include at least one 'failure' scenario along with the traditional 'successful' scenarios. Each team member should be responsible for at least one diagram.
- 📖 Include at least one User Story, following standard Agile practices, that details a user interaction feature of the ÉirVid system that we would like to have included in a future version that is not currently part of the original system description.
